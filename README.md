# Software Quality Books

A web application for managing and reviewing software quality books.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A code editor (we recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FriendlyTester/software-quality-books
cd software-quality-books
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   - Update the following variables in `.env`:
     - `DATABASE_URL`: Your database connection string
     - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`
     - `NEXTAUTH_URL`: `http://localhost:3000` for local development

4. Set up the database:
```bash
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
```

5. Seed the database with initial data:
```bash
npm run seed
```

6. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Test Users

After seeding the database, you can log in with these test accounts:
- Email: `test@test.com` / Password: `password123`
- Email: `bob@example.com` / Password: `password123`

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e
```
